## Features:
___________________
	NoOby is a plugin that enables blocks such as Grass, Glowstone, Glass, Ice, Bookshelves & Snow to drop just like any other block. 
	NoOby also makes the mining Obsidian difficult with an 80% chance for drops. 
	This is one way to slow down Obsidian bunkers people make on Factions enabled servers. 
	To effectively make a difference and slow down obsidian bunkers this plugin is best combined with DynaMight.
